### Project Title: 
Probabilistic Techniques and Data Structures for High Performance Database Management Systems
### Principle Investigator: 
Dr. Sinan Yıldırım
### Project Managers: 
Dr. Sinan Yıldırım, Dr. Erdinç Öztürk, Dr. Kamer Kaya
### Project Type: 
TÜBİTAK 1003 - Innovative Database Management Systems Call
### Project Duration: 
24 Months
### Project Start Date: 
September 2019


## The project
- will find its place in the world of big data and will be able to commercialize, accordingly, has a columnar structure designed in accordance with OLTP (online analytical processing) analytic queries and tasks instead of classical OLTP (online transaction processing).
- will provide a probabilistic differential privacy guarantee of the analysis results when necessary, which will allow safe sharing of the analysis results instead of sharing the actual internal data
- will utilize multiple CPUs, field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and graphics processing units (GPU) efficiently on a single query simultaneously, or distributed intelligently on different queries with smart load balance methods
- can create data samples and sketches with high performance and use them for different purposes such as privacy, query optimization, producing almost exact analysis results
- will improve performance with query optimization methods that work in a heterogeneous system
- with the help of user friendly toolsets and interfaces, an innovative database management system that can be utilized to generate dynamic and static queries will be developed.
